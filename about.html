                Hi, and welcome to Piano With Georgia. I’m Georgia. Let me tell you a little bit about myself.
            </p>
            <p>
                I started taking piano lessons when I was six years old. My mom would frequently play piano music in our home, 
                and one day I told her that I would like to learn how to do that! And so the adventure began… 
            </p>
            <p>
                I have now been a private piano teacher for over 30 years! I completed my Bachelor's in Music degree in Piano Performance at Grand Canyon University in Phoenix, AZ.  Then I went on to earn my Master’s of Music degree in Piano Performance and Pedagogy from University of Houston. I have had a very wide variety of experience teaching. I’ve been a college professor, and I’ve been “the piano teacher down the street” teaching from my home. 
            </p>
            <p>
                My students have been just as diverse in their playing as I have been in my teaching. I’ve had students participate in local and state competitions, win prizes and go on to major in music themselves. I’ve also had students who play for their churches, their schools, their communities and simply for themselves. I’m so proud to have been a part of each and every one of their lives. 
            </p>
            <p>
                My top priority as a teacher is to deliver quality musical information in a way that passes along the joy of learning and playing music to my students. I tailor style and musical choices individually to motivate students and help them find their own passions. Music lessons are also life lessons, and I like to help all students make that connection. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Music can be learned in such varied styles - by listening, by reading, by watching. I like to use a lot of improvisation and composition in addition to learning the music of other composers to help students become well rounded musicians who can rise to any occasion of their choosing.
