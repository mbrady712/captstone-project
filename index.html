                So, here’s the thing. I’ve been a classroom teacher for 20 years, and still I am regularly 
                amazed at the instructional moves that Georgia has with my 5 year old- and that’s online! 
                When my daughter gets silly, she’s able to roll with it and then gently move her into a more 
                productive task. When my daughter has something she’s interested in, Georgia flexibly moved 
                the piano lesson in that direction, but still covers so many skill. As a result, my kid loves 
                her piano lessons AND is progressing at a very age-appropriate pace. Did I mention she’s 
                able to do all of this virtually? Georgia is truly the best teacher we could have ever 
                hoped for.<br>

                "Our daughter has been taking piano lessons remotely with Georgia for many months now 
                and we love it! Wish it could be in person but we live too far away. My daughter has 
                learned so much in this short time and is being challenged. Georgia is professional 
                and fun and just makes you feel comfortable :) we highly recommend her!"<br>

                "Georgia truly is a fantastic piano teacher and  musician. She is extremely knowledgeable 
                and her teaching style has made my son’s lessons with her productive and meaningful. 
                He truly enjoys learning from her and is growing week by week!  I cannot recommend her 
                highly enough! She is outstanding!"<br>

                "I have been attending lessons with Mrs. Sears for some time now and I absolutely adore each 
                moment with her. She takes time to talk about personal things as well as teaching piano, 
                that allows us to respect each other and learn from one another. I recommend her as a piano 
                teacher!"<br>
